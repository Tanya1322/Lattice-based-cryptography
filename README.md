# Lattice-based-cryptography

This is a family of post qauntum cryptography where integral lattices are used.
The repository conatins implementations of various hard problems related to lattice based cryptography:
-> Learning with error
-> Ring Learning with error
-> LLL Lattice Basis Reduction Algorithm
